=== talk_to_brigid
Brigid tags along. Her next class isn't for another hour, and she's in no rush to get to it.
It's a good chance to talk if you have anything on your mind.

    Maybe even a safer time to talk without Felixe here. 
    {jonesLikes_Felixe > 0:
        You don't hate the guy, but you're getting some weird vibes from him. Having private conversations before you figure him out won't hurt.
        - else:
        You're getting bad vibes from the guy. He hasn't done anything to warrant them yet, you guess, but it's nice to have a chance to talk to Brigid without him around.

    "He seems nice enough," she says. "Class seems like it's going to be a little... weird with him?"
    You laugh. "Yeah, that back and forth with Osbourne was wild. I think my other professors would kill me if I talked to them like that."
    "Exactly! {interrupt:I can't <i>believe</i> you managed to get in the middle of that. I wonder how long it would have gone otherwise. If |Felixe seemed to put an end to it, but if} he's that opinionated on the first day of class, I wonder what the rest of the semester will be like."
    "For real! Maybe it'll be more exciting than a normal blow off class."
    Brigid giggles. "What about you?"
    
    * "He seems fun[."]," you say. "I think we vibe on some of the same frequencies."
        "Should I be worried?"
        "What? No! You're my bestie for life!" you insist.
        Brigid rolls her eyes with a smile. "I was more meaning on if you've found a potential partner in chaos."
        You laugh. "We'll see!"

            That's putting it lightly, really. He really seems to rub you the wrong way. Or you him. Maybe that's just a coincidence, or maybe you're trying not to be so negative about it to Brigid.

        "Oh, no! I thought since he offered to drive you, you might have a better opinion of him. Not that you have to like everyone who does something nice for you, of course!" she quickly adds. "Or that doing something nice means they like <i>you</i>, or, well." She sighs. "You know what I mean."
        "I know what you mean," you agree with a smile. "But we've only known each other for what, a couple hours tops? Plenty of time for things to change, one way or the other."

           Looking back on the day, it <i>did</i> seem like you were getting along, but appearances can be deceiving. Just because you agreed on a few things or shared a sense of humor doesn't mean you like the guy, or he you.
        - jonesLikes_Felixe==0:
            It didn't seem like you got on that poorly, but not actively being antagonistic doesn't mean positive or even neutral feelings. Hopefully you won't have to see him much more after class, even if you did appreciate the ride.
        - else:
            Yeah, you really didn't vibe with the guy. The ride was fine, but you probably would have been fine on your {jonesRide} anyway. The less you have to interact with him from now on, the better.

        You hesitate for a second. It's not like you have a lot to go on by now, just a balled up piece of paper in his backpack.
        Brigid notices your pause. "Is there something else?"
        "Well..." You rub the back of your head. "It's probably nothing, but after reading the syllabus, I was kinda looking around the room to see how other people reacted, because it was weird, right?"
        "Yes, especially with what we know now, the syllabus is <i>extremely</i> weird," Brigid agrees.
        "Right! So I looked at Felixe, because at the time I couldn't remember why I recognized him, but the syllabus wasn't on his desk. It was crumpled into a ball in his bag." 
        "And that's... weird?" Brigid asks doubtfully.
        Now that you say it out loud, maybe it really <i>isn't</i> that weird.

 you ask.
 "He's... interesting?" Brigid says with a shrug.
 "That's one way to put it," you say with a laugh. <> {jonesSuspicious_Osbourne > 0:
    "I think maybe there's something shady going on with him."
    "Like with the syllabus?"
    "Yeah, that, but also... I mean, he kept looking at us weird? You, me and Felixe. He barely glanced at anyone else. Not to mention {knownames:
        he knew our names, he knew <i>my</i> name preference. No one knows that."
        Brigid considers this. "He said it was on the student information sheets."
        "Yeah, but I've thought about that since then, and all my other professors have call me Olivia before I correct them."
        }
        Brigid twists a strand of hair around her finger. "I guess I've gotten some weird vibes from him, too. I just don't think it's anything substantial, outside of the syllabus, of course."
        You shrug. "It's not like there's anything to do about it. He's still our teacher and all. Just thought I'd mention it."
        Brigid gives you a reassuring pat on the shoulder. "We have all semester to figure him out."
        - else:
